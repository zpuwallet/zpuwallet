.SYNOPSIS
    Run the fast, Dart-only verification for zkool on Windows: `flutter pub get`,
    optionally `dart run build_runner` (freezed / riverpod / FRB-adjacent codegen),
    and `flutter analyze`.

.DESCRIPTION
    This is the cheap pre-flight to run BEFORE the slow native build
    (`build-win.ps1`). It compiles nothing in Rust and needs no MSVC / vcpkg /
    OpenSSL - it only exercises the Dart analyzer, so it surfaces Dart mistakes in
    seconds instead of after a ~10-minute cargokit Rust compile.

    Typical flow when you've changed Dart and/or regenerated FRB bindings:
        .\misc\flutter.ps1       # pub get + analyze
        .\misc\build-win.ps1     # full native build once analyze is clean

    Use -BuildRunner when you've changed @freezed / @riverpod declarations (or any
    annotation that drives generated *.g.dart / *.freezed.dart) and need those
    regenerated. Plain functions / widgets / enums do NOT need it.

    Flutter is provided the same way as build-win.ps1: this script clones a pinned
    Flutter into build-win\flutter (first run), or reuses one via -FlutterDir, or
    falls back to whatever `flutter` is on PATH with -FlutterVersion "".

.PARAMETER BuildRunner
    Run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` before analyze
    to regenerate freezed / riverpod outputs.

.PARAMETER Watch
    Run build_runner in watch mode (`dart run build_runner watch`) instead of a
    one-shot build. Implies -BuildRunner. Analyze is skipped in watch mode (the
    command runs until you Ctrl-C it).

.PARAMETER SkipPubGet
    Skip `flutter pub get` (useful for repeat runs).

.PARAMETER SkipAnalyze
    Skip `flutter analyze` (e.g. when you only want to regenerate code).

.PARAMETER FlutterVersion
    Flutter version (git branch/tag) to clone into build-win\flutter, mirroring
    build-win.ps1. Default: 3.44.2. Set to "" to use whatever `flutter` is on PATH.

.PARAMETER FlutterDir
    Use an existing Flutter SDK at this path instead of cloning. Its bin\ is
    prepended to PATH for this process only. Overrides -FlutterVersion.

.EXAMPLE
    .\misc\flutter.ps1
    flutter pub get + flutter analyze.

.EXAMPLE
    .\misc\flutter.ps1 -BuildRunner
    pub get + regenerate freezed/riverpod + analyze.

.EXAMPLE
    .\misc\flutter.ps1 -FlutterDir C:\flutter -SkipPubGet
    Use an existing SDK, skip pub get, just analyze.

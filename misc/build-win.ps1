.SYNOPSIS
    Compile zkool and produce zkool-<version>.zip locally on Windows using the
    NATIVE MSVC toolchain (no MSYS2), WITHOUT needing Strawberry Perl / NASM /
    a vendored-OpenSSL from-source build.

.DESCRIPTION
    This is the MSVC alternative to build-win.ps1 (which uses the MSYS2 / UCRT64
    GNU toolchain). It builds zkool exactly the way CI does - letting Flutter /
    cargokit compile the Rust `rlz` crate during `flutter build windows` with the
    MSVC toolchain (x86_64-pc-windows-msvc) - and changes only ONE thing versus CI:
    it injects OPENSSL_* environment variables so the Rust openssl-sys crate links
    a PREBUILT vcpkg OpenSSL instead of compiling OpenSSL from source.

    The OpenSSL problem: zkool's Rust crate forces
    `libsqlite3-sys = { features = ["bundled-sqlcipher-vendored-openssl"] }`,
    whose `vendored-openssl` normally compiles OpenSSL FROM C SOURCE - which
    needs a native Windows Perl + NASM. CI gets away with it because the
    windows-latest runners ship Perl + NASM; locally we usually don't. We defeat
    it with `OPENSSL_NO_VENDOR=1`, which makes openssl-sys consume vcpkg's prebuilt
    OpenSSL instead of vendoring (the env var overrides the Cargo feature at build
    time). vcpkg ships its own Perl for ITS one-time build, so you never install
    Perl yourself.

    Why env injection is enough: cargokit runs `rustup run stable cargo build
    --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --features=...` and passes the current process
    environment straight through to cargo (it adds nothing for non-Android targets).
    So setting OPENSSL_* + RUSTFLAGS in this PowerShell process is all cargo needs.
    The feature list comes from rust/cargokit.yaml (cargo.release.extra_flags),
    exactly like CI's misc/mkcargokit_options.sh - this script writes that file.

    PREREQUISITE: OpenSSL must already be installed via vcpkg for the MSVC triplet.
    This script does NOT install it (see build-win.md). Install it once with:
        C:\vcpkg\vcpkg.exe install openssl:x64-windows-static-md

    Concretely:
      1. Verify vcpkg has openssl:x64-windows-static-md installed.
      2. Write rust/cargokit.yaml so cargokit builds with --features=<Feature>.
      3. Prepend the VS x64 toolchain to PATH for THIS process only (so the right
         link.exe wins even if MSYS2 etc. is on PATH), and set OPENSSL_* + RUSTFLAGS.
      4. flutter build windows --release  (cargokit compiles rlz.dll with MSVC,
         linking the vcpkg OpenSSL; no cargokit bypass, no manual cargo build).
      5. Zip the Release folder as out\zkool-<version>.zip.

.PARAMETER Feature
    Rust cargo feature to enable (written into rust/cargokit.yaml). CI uses
    "ledger". Default: ledger.

.PARAMETER VcpkgRoot
    Path to the vcpkg installation (must contain vcpkg.exe). If omitted, it is
    auto-resolved in this order: $env:VCPKG_ROOT -> the directory of `vcpkg` on
    PATH (`where vcpkg`) -> C:\vcpkg. Pass this only to override that search.

.PARAMETER OpensslTriplet
    vcpkg triplet for OpenSSL. Default: x64-windows-static-md (static OpenSSL libs
    linked against the dynamic CRT /MD, matching Rust-msvc's default). Do NOT use
    x64-windows-static (static CRT /MT) - it mismatches Rust and causes LNK2038.

.PARAMETER SkipPubGet
    Skip `flutter pub get` (useful for repeat builds).

.PARAMETER Clean
    Clear all build caches before building. Runs `flutter clean` and removes the
    `build\` directory plus cargokit's Rust target output. Use this when CMake
    complains the CMakeCache.txt was generated for a different source directory
    (which happens after copying/moving/cloning the project to a new path).

.PARAMETER FlutterVersion
    Flutter version (git branch/tag) to clone into build-win\flutter and use for
    the build, mirroring zwallet's build-win.ps1. Default: 3.44.2. Set to ""
    to use whatever `flutter` is already on PATH instead of cloning.

.PARAMETER FlutterDir
    Use an existing Flutter SDK at this path instead of cloning. Its bin\ is
    prepended to PATH for this process only. Overrides -FlutterVersion.

.EXAMPLE
    .\misc\build-win.ps1
    Builds out\zkool-%VERSION%.zip (cargokit compiles the Rust during the build).

.EXAMPLE
    .\misc\build-win.ps1 -Feature ""
    Builds with the crate's default features only.

.EXAMPLE
    .\misc\build-win.ps1 -FlutterDir C:\flutter
    Uses an already-installed Flutter SDK instead of cloning one.

# Newer MSVC/clang-cl toolsets (VS 2026, MSVC 14.5x) compile the C++ Flutter
# plugins more strictly and emit a flood of warnings from THIRD-PARTY plugin
# sources we don't own. We suppress those specific diagnostics process-scoped
# (nothing is written into the plugin trees), via env vars the compilers read:
#
#  * flutter_inappwebview_windows + local_auth_windows include the deprecated
#    <experimental/coroutine>, which MSVC's STL now turns into a hard error
#    (STL1011 / C2338). cl.exe AND clang-cl both read the CL env var (prepended
#    to the command line); a plain /D define is safe for every target.
#  * flutter_inappwebview_windows + the bundled WebView2 header spam cl.exe
#    warnings C4244 (int64->int conversion) and C4458 (declaration hides member).
#    /wdNNNN in CL disables them for cl.exe targets - harmless to ours, which
#    don't trip these. (Pure noise; the build already succeeds without this.)
#  * rive_common's bundled harfbuzz emits hundreds of -Wnontrivial-memcall
#    warnings (memcpy on a non-trivially-copyable type). CCC_OVERRIDE_OPTIONS is
#    read ONLY by the clang driver (clang-cl) - cl.exe never sees it. The leading
#    '^' means "APPEND this argument" (clang's override syntax), so the flag lands
#    at the END of the command line - AFTER the plugin's own /WX (-Werror). That
#    ordering is why we can fully SILENCE here with -Wno-nontrivial-memcall: the
#    same flag in windows/CMakeLists.txt gets overridden by a later /WX (see
#    commit 67856063), which is why that file must keep the weaker -Wno-error=
#    form as the CI safety net. Appending wins, so locally we kill the noise too.

#Requires -Version 5.1

.SYNOPSIS
    Compile zkool and produce zkool-<version>.zip locally on Windows, WITHOUT
    needing Strawberry Perl / NASM / a vendored-OpenSSL MSVC build.

.DESCRIPTION
    Problem: zkool's Rust crate pulls in OpenSSL (via SQLCipher /
    `bundled-sqlcipher-vendored-openssl` and arti/tor). cargokit normally
    compiles that Rust through the MSVC toolchain during `flutter build windows`,
    which forces OpenSSL to build from C source and needs a native Windows Perl
    + NASM. That path is fragile and broke locally.

    Solution (mirrors what zwallet does): build the Rust library OURSELVES
    first, using the MSYS2 / UCRT64 GNU toolchain (gcc + the prebuilt UCRT64
    OpenSSL), then hand the finished rlz.dll to Flutter so cargokit does not
    have to compile anything. Concretely:

      1. cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu  (uses UCRT64 OpenSSL, no Perl/NASM)
         -> rlz.dll
      2. Replace the rlz plugin's windows/CMakeLists.txt with a version that
         skips cargokit (apply_cargokit) and bundles our prebuilt rlz.dll. rlz is
         an FFI plugin, so the runner .exe loads rlz.dll at runtime and never
         links it - no import lib is needed.
      3. flutter build windows  (run inside the UCRT64 environment; no cargo runs).
      4. Copy rlz.dll + liblzma-5.dll next to zkool.exe in the Release folder.
      5. Zip the Release folder as out\zkool-<version>.zip.

    The swapped rlz windows/CMakeLists.txt is restored on exit (even on failure).

.PARAMETER Feature
    Rust cargo feature to enable. CI uses "ledger". Default: ledger.

.PARAMETER Msys2Root
    Path to the MSYS2 installation. Default: C:\msys64.

.PARAMETER SkipRustBuild
    Skip the cargo build if target\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\release\rlz.dll already exists.

.PARAMETER SkipPubGet
    Skip `flutter pub get` (useful for repeat builds).

.PARAMETER FlutterVersion
    Flutter version (git branch/tag) to clone into build-win\flutter and use for
    the build, mirroring zwallet's build-msys2.ps1. Default: 3.44.1. Set to ""
    to use whatever `flutter` is already on PATH instead of cloning.

.PARAMETER FlutterDir
    Use an existing Flutter SDK at this path instead of cloning. Its bin\ is
    prepended to PATH for this process only. Overrides -FlutterVersion.

.EXAMPLE
    .\misc\build-msys2.ps1
    Builds out\zkool-%VERSION%.zip.

.EXAMPLE
    .\misc\build-msys2.ps1 -SkipRustBuild
    Reuses an already-compiled rlz.dll and just re-runs the Flutter build + zip.

.EXAMPLE
    .\misc\build-msys2.ps1 -FlutterDir C:\flutter
    Uses an already-installed Flutter SDK instead of cloning one.
